1. Create `.env.local` in the root folder with following variables

```javascript
SANITY_DATASET_NAME=YOUR_DATASET_NAME //from sanity account
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID //from sanity account
SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET=YOUR_PREVIEW_SECRET // unique string
SANITY_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN //from sanity account
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
